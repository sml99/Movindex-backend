      <plot>Training your friends on a volunteer fire department,two boys adrift on a home made raft and a bootlegger are some of the story lines of this episode.There are a couple of scenes that don,t match the time of day or the location of the plot which makes me wonder if this was rushed into production making it one of the reasons why only 13 episodes where ever produced as C.B.S. answer to the TV series Emergency on N.B.C.
