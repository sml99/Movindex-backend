         <trivia>- The Miami-Dade Police Department's crime lab really is called Crime Scene Investigations, unlike Las Vegas which where they are called Crime Scene Technicians &amp; New York where they are called C.S.U (which stands for Crime Scene Unit). 
         </trivia>
         <trivia>- This episode served as the pilot for the spin-off, _"CSI: Miami" (2002)_ (qv). 
         </trivia>
         <trivia>- Gil Grissom doesn't share any lines or scenes with any of the Miami CSI team. This is because 'William Petersen' (qv) was against CSI spin-offs and asked the producers of CSI not to put him in any scenes with the _"CSI: Miami" (2002)_ (qv) cast. 
         </trivia>
         <trivia>- This episode is featured on both the CSI Complete Second Season and the CSI: Miami Complete First Season DVDs. 
         </trivia>
         <trivia>- The CBS network and CSI producers decided to create the spin-off series _"CSI: Miami" (2002)_ (qv) (and later _"CSI: NY" (2004)_ (qv)) because they wanted to beat other potential CSI copycat shows to the punch.
         </trivia>

      <goofs>
         <goof>- FAKE: Mina Rittle's corpse is clearly seen to be breathing when she is pulled out of the canal. 
         </goof>
         <goof>- CREW: When Catherine is running through the house at the beginning of the episode, she runs past a mirror (or a door w/ a reflective surface). The camera and crew are clearly visible (evenif only for a split second via frame-step) in the reflection. 
         </goof>
         <goof>- FACT: When figuring out what the criminal's "fruity scent" is caused from, Grissom tells Katherine that it's because of Diabetic Ketoacetosis, which is treated with Novolin Insulin. This, however, cannot be the case since Ketoacetosis is, in fact, a very debilitating complication that can result from diabetes, which would either require extensive hospitalization or, in less severe cases, a treatment that would last, at most, a single day. Not only that, but Novolin Insulin isn't a specific type of insulin, it's a genetically similar to human insulin created by Squibb-Novo, making it a brand name instead of a treatment, and would, more than likely, be a constant running medication instead of just for the one condition.
